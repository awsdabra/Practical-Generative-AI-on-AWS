**Building generative AI applications with Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, and Amazon Q**

Published by BPB Publications

## üìö About This Book

GenAI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time, fundamentally changing how we build software and solve business problems. Unlike traditional AI that analyzes data to make predictions or classifications and usually requires training separate models for each specific task, GenAI provides powerful pre-trained models that can generate entirely new content from text and code to images and audio, while understanding context and responding to diverse prompts without additional training.

This repository contains the complete code examples and resources for **"Practical Generative AI on AWS"** - your comprehensive guide to navigating AWS's complete GenAI ecosystem and building intelligent applications that deliver real business value. The book covers the spectrum of AWS GenAI services like Amazon Bedrock for managed foundation models, Amazon SageMaker JumpStart for flexible ML development, and Amazon Q for business and developer productivity.

You will learn essential techniques from prompt engineering and systematic model evaluation to advanced implementations like RAG with Knowledge Bases that enhance responses with proprietary data. The book then advances to autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows using both Amazon Bedrock's managed agents and open-source agentic AI frameworks.

By the end of this book, you will have the knowledge, architectural patterns, and strategies needed to build GenAI solutions on AWS, whether you are just getting started with GenAI or building enterprise-scale multi-agent systems.
