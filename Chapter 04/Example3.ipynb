      "Minor Damage:\n",
      "- The windshield seems to be intact, but there may be minor cracks or chips that need to be addressed.\n",
      "- The side mirrors and other exterior trim pieces may have sustained minor scratches or dents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Repair Considerations:\n",
      "Given the severity of the front-end damage, it is likely that the vehicle will require extensive repairs or potentially be deemed a total loss (if the repair costs exceed a certain percentage of the vehicle's value). Repairs may involve replacing the entire front-end assembly, including the hood, bumper, headlights, radiator, and potentially the front frame rails. Proper alignment and structural integrity must be ensured for safe operation.\n",

      "Approximate Average Cost:\n",
      "The cost of repairs for this level of damage can vary significantly depending on the make and model of the vehicle, the availability of parts, and the labor rates in the area. However, as a rough estimate, major front-end collision repairs can range from $5,000 to $15,000 or more for a typical passenger vehicle.\n",
