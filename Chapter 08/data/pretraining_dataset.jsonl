{"input": "Asthma is a respiratory condition in which airways narrow and swell, producing extra mucus. This makes breathing difficult and triggers coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Triggers can include allergens, exercise, and respiratory infections."}
{"input": "Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, and behavior."}

{"input": "Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, often due to abnormally high pressure in the eye. It is one of the leading causes of blindness and often has no early symptoms, making regular eye exams crucial for detection."}
{"input": "Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues. The exact cause is unknown, but it may be triggered by physical trauma, surgery, infection, or psychological stress."}
