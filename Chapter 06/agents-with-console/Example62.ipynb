        "### Step 1: Navigate to Amazon Bedrock Console\n",
        "1. Go to AWS Console â†’ Amazon Bedrock\n",
        "2. Select \"Agents\" from the left navigation\n",
        "3. Click \"Create agent\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Configure Agent\n",
        "1. **Agent name**: `customer-support-agent`\n",
        "2. **Description**: `Customer support agent created via console`\n",
        "3. **Foundation model**: Select Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 or latest foundational model\n",
        "4. **Agent instructions**: Use the content from `data/agent_instructions.txt`\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Create Action Groups\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Action Group 1: Order Management\n",
        "1. Click \"Add action group\"\n",
        "2. **Action group name**: `order-action-group`\n",
        "3. **Description**: `Handles order placement, tracking, and cancellation`\n",
        "4. **Lambda function**: Select the deployed `order_lambda` function from `../agents-with-api/` directory\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Action Group 2: Return and Refund Processing\n",
        "1. Click \"Add action group\" again\n",
        "2. **Action group name**: `return-refund-action-group`\n",
        "3. **Description**: `Handles return requests and refund processing`\n",
        "4. **Lambda function**: Select the deployed `returnrefund_lambda` function from `../agents-with-api/` directory\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Test the Agent\n",
        "1. Save and prepare the agent\n",
        "2. Use the test interface to interact with the agent\n",
        "3. Test both action groups with the following scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Order Management Tests:\n",
        "- **Place Order**: \"I want to order z12 wireless headphones and have them delivered to John Doe at 123 Main St, Austin, Texas. Use my default credit card.\"\n",
        "- **Track Order**: \"I want to get the details for order ORD12345.\"\n",
        "- **Cancel Order**: \"Can you help cancel my order ORD12345?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Return and Refund Tests:\n",
        "- **Initiate Return**: \"I want to return my order ORD12345 because the product arrived damaged.\"\n",
